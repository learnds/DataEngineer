    "#### Project Summary\n",
    "The project aims to build a cloud based datawarehouse in Redshift for analysing International visitor statistics by the US National Tourism and Trade Office. They would like to understand the distribution of visitors around all the airports in the US and the seasonal change in number of vistors. This would enable them to assign approriate number of personnel so visitor entry is efficiently handled. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project follows the follow steps:\n",
    "* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data\n",
    "* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data\n",
    "* Step 3: Define the Data Model\n",
    "* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data\n",
    "* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up"

    "\n",
    "The US Tourism and Trade office would like to understand the following visitor statistics using the I-94 vistor arrival data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visitor arrival by month and year\n",

    "The proposed solution is to use AWS to build a cloud Data warehouse to anwer their questions. The use of AWS cloud technology enables linear scalabity as the data set grows. AWS also supports a variety of techonologies such as S3, Reshift, EMR and Cassandra suitable for handling massive amounts of data and also to proivde fast response times to end user queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initial data analysis is done by using PySpark in the local notebook and rest of the data transformation is handled by Redshift SQL during the ETL stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be loaded into fact and dimension tables in an Amazon Redshift data warehouse hosted in the cloud. Data is first copied to Amazon S3 service. Using S3 service will enable to scale the data staging area in case huge gigabyte size files are required to be processed. Also, the storage can be scaled back once the processing is done to save cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be first loaded into staging tables in Amazon Redshift using Copy statements. Following this, data cleansing can be perfomed and data loaded into fact and dimension tables using insert statements. The same SQL queries can be used to create ETL pipelines if required at a later stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describe and Gather Data\n",

    "The project uses the following Udacity supplied data sets to build the data warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I94 immigration SAS data files\n",
    "   This data is provided by the US travel department and is available here - https://travel.trade.gov/research/reports/i94/historical/2016.html\n",

    "3. The aiport data is augmented by a manually created airport.csv file from the provided data dictionary.\n",

    "5. State demographics in the supploed us-cities-demographics.csv file\n",

    "##### Fact table - i94visitors_fact\n",

    "The fact table contains most of the columns from the source SAS files so no detail is lost. All analytical queries can be run on this fact table. The data model can be enhanced by building \n",
    "summary fact tables to speed up queries if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### airports_dim\n",
    "This dimension table is loaded from airport-codes csv file after cleaning up non US airports. The airports dimension provides details about each of the airports in the US and can help disect the fact table by airport\n",
    "\n",
    "##### states_dim\n",
    "The states dimension provides state level demographics such as total population and foreign born population and can provide insights into number of visitors arriving in a state and its foreign born population. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### dates_dim\n",

    "##### countries_dim\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data model would provide US travel department with a lot of insights such as where people are arriving from and during what season. Although data for all air travellers is not captured here, it would still help various US travel departments to better provision their airport resources and personnel and also help the states involved in performing future capacity planning and upgrades of their airports.  The US embassies in various countries can all augment their staff and capacity based on this data.\n",

    "#### Step 5: Complete Project Write Up\n",
    "* Clearly state the rationale for the choice of tools and technologies for the project.\n",
    "A cloud based solution such as AWS provides high scalability and high availability. Nodes can be added and removed dynamically, storage can be expanded with virtually as much storage as you afford.\n",
    "Data is initially staged in Amazon S3 which provides high performance storage and supports parquet format to handle massive amounts of data.\n",
    "Redshift is a very popular AWS database for hosting Data Warehouses. It is highly scalable and a clusted can be spun up in minutes. It provides many ways to partition data as well. Since it is directly licensed by Amazon, no additional licensing costs are incurred apart from the usage fee.\n",
    "The ETL pipeline is handled by Apache Airflow that is a fairly mature Opensource tool for handling DAGs. It can seamlessly connect to AWS to run ETL at various schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Propose how often the data should be updated and why.\n",
    "Data as in the supplied dataset can be loaded on a monthly basis. The SAS files are partitioned by month and are probably available at the beginning of the following month. Initial analysis shows that the monthly volume is around 3 million rows which is pretty small and is easily handled by a 2 node Redshift cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a description of how you would approach the problem differently under the following scenarios:\n",
    " * The data was increased by 100x.\n",
    " If the data set increases by 100x, that would amount to 300 million rows per month. While this can be easily ingested into a 16 node (or larger) high performance SSD Redshift cluster, resources may not see full utilization after the load is complete. It is best to receive smaller SAS datasets on a daily basis that would amount to 10 million rows and can be efficiently loaded using a 8 node cluster.\n",
    " \n",
    " * The data populates a dashboard that must be updated on a daily basis by 7am every day.\n",
    " The SLA here is load the dashboard data by 7 am. The Airflow DAG can be set up with a 'sla' parameter setting to ensure loads complete by 6 am to provide some buffer. A 'sla_miss_callback' function can be implemented in the DAG to alery oncall personnel in case the loads do not complete on time. \n",
    " \n",
    " * The database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.\n",
    " This is a read heavy scenario. \n",
    " A 16 or 32 node Redshift cluster can be created to support 100's of users.\n",
    " Depending on the queries, additional summary tables also called cubes can be created as part of the ETL to support summarization queries. \n",
    " Smaller  tables can use the distribution feature and larger tables can use the sorted key feature to store data in the sorted order to  improve query performance for useds.\n",
    " Redshift materialized views can also be created to support such summarizations transparaently. \n",
    " If the users need to query detailed data, one or more Cassandra tables can be created based on the user queries on appropriately sized cluster to provide response times of less than a few seconds or less than a second."
